/**
 * Exercise 20:
 *
 * 1. Create a class named `Person` that takes in as parameters
 *
 *    firstName
 *    lastName
 *
 * 2. The class should use the constructor method to receive
 *    the parameters for when a new instance of the class
 *    is created.
 *
 * 3. Once you have created the Person class, you should
 *    create a new person using the `new Person(...)`
 *    expression. Then, you should store the newly created
 *    person in the `ana` variable.
 *
 * 4. The class should also have a method named `sayName`
 *    that returns the concatenation of the firstName and lastName
 *    with an empty space in between.
 *
 *    @example
 *
 *    "Alex Marks"
 */

// Create the Person class
class Person {}

// Create a new instance of the class with the arguments:
//
// firstName: "Ana"
// lastName: "Spark"
//
// Store the new instance in the `ana` variable
let ana = "";

// Donâ€™t change the code bellow this line
export { Person, ana };
